AB A numerical method for designing operating software for digital controllers of hybrid discrete-continuous control systems is considered. The method is based on implementing control algorithms on digital controller in the form of rule-based systems and uses a fuzzy optimization procedure to define controller operation rules. The continuous part of hybrid control systems consists of multiple-operation technological chains, which are nonlinear, multidimensional and multi-loop plants, and the discrete part consists of digital controllers. The developed digital controllers ensure satisfaction of the most general requirements for controlled processes, including fuzzy ones.

AB Mobile robot control is a challenging task due to the need for lightning-fast decision making in a rapidly changing environment. We propose neural net with reinforcement learning based control system which can simultaneously manage mobile robots and communicate with other partners. The Actor Critic approach is used but we divide the Actor into the Communication Actor and Action Actor. Due to the fact that, unlike the classical approach, additional neural networks appeared, the question of optimization arose. We propose implementation of control system on three different platform: desktop, mobile and embedded platform with VPU acceleration. We demonstrate that we achieve similar performance and speed of low power embedded and mobile devices and full power desktop PC with modern GPU acceleration.

AB A method for constructing a multi-agent control system for mobile robots based on training with reinforcement using deep neural networks is considered. Synthesis of the management system is proposed to be carried out with reinforcement training and the modified Actor-Critic method, in which the Actor module is divided into Action Actor and Communication Actor in order to simultaneously manage mobile robots and communicate with partners. Communication is carried out by sending partners at each step a vector of real numbers that are added to the observation vector and affect the behaviour. Functions of Actors and Critic are approximated by deep neural networks. The Critics value function is trained by using the TD-error method and the Actor's function by using DDPG. The Communication Actor's neural network is trained through gradients received from partner agents. An environment in which a cooperative multi-agent interaction is present was developed, computer simulation of the application of this method in the control problem of two robots pursuing two goals was carried out.

AB The procedure of fuzzy optimization is considered as the problem of forklift path planning in a changing environment for a number of typical situations differing in the goals of the forklift and the constraints imposed both on control resources and on the behavior of forklifts. Simultaneously with the construction of trajectories of forklift, the synthesis of algorithms for the work of digital controllers of forklift control systems as hybrid continuous-discrete systems is carried out. The procedure for constructing control systems with fuzzy goals and constraints is based on the representation of control algorithms in the form of a priori non-fixed and time-variable systems of rules.

In the decision quality assessment, the total time spent on executing the task of transferring an object to a given point is taken into account, including the time for the control program calculation and the time of the object movement to the target. Both online and offline variants of the production model numerical determination of the controller as a system of rules "condition" - "action" are considered. As an online variant, it is suggested to use an anytime genetic algorithm. A comparison between online and offline methods of calculating a rule system for the regulator performance is made. The advantages of the online method in solving the problem of transferring the mobile cyber physical system in a homogeneous environment and the advantages of an offline method in a heterogeneous environment are demonstrated.

AB The problem of optimization of reliability and economical indexes is solved for informational/technical system with periodical diagnostics and restoration. The system considered is the one with users accesses and errors occurring. The probability that the error occurs increases in time. Therefore, the longer is the restoration period the more there is a risk of system operation with error. But too frequent restoration can be too expensive. To take into account all these factors two-criteria optimization is made with the restriction of reliability characteristic being of the given level.

AB In this paper we consider the problem of mobile robot motion planning in a heterogeneous environment consisting of mandatory to visit zone and prohibited areas. Control system rules synthesis is proposed to be conducted with vaguely defined requirements for object behaviour. Examples of using this method for solving the problem of mobile robot control system synthesis are given.
